# bagbak

Yet another frida based App decryptor. Requires jailbroken iOS device and [frida.re](https://www.frida.re/)

![demo](images/screenshot.gif)

*The name of this project doesn't have any meaning. I was just listening to that song while typing.*

## Prerequisites

### On device

* [frida.re](https://www.frida.re/docs/ios/)

That's all. No SSH required.

### On desktop

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Latest LTS (Long Term Support)
* `zip` command (optional). We'll generate an ipa archive when this command is avaliable

That's all. Npm can handle all dependencies.

### Windows Compatibility

* Before `frida@12.5.5` it was unable to connect device via USB (ref: [12.5 release note](https://frida.re/news/2019/05/15/frida-12-5-released/)). Please use up-to-date frida to overcome this;
* Filesystem of iOS differs from Windows. If you are running bagbak on Windows, **some of the file attributes (e.g., executable bit) will be lost**, thus the repacked ipa may not be able to reinstall on your phone. But it does not matter if you only indend to do static analysis.

## Install

```
npm install -g bagbak
```

bagbak [bundle id or name]

```

   -l, --list             list apps
